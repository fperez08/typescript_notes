1. **IDE Setup and Extensions:**

   - Ensure you have the correct extensions installed for TypeScript development in your integrated development environment (IDE).
   - Key extensions include ESLint for linting TypeScript code, Prettier for code formatting, and Debugger for Chrome for enhanced debugging capabilities.

2. **ESLint for Code Quality:**

   - ESLint aids in maintaining code quality by identifying and highlighting issues in TypeScript code.
   - Additional configuration may be required for ESLint to effectively influence your codebase.

3. **Prettier for Code Formatting:**

   - Prettier is recommended for automatic code formatting, ensuring a consistent and well-formatted codebase.
   - Integration with Prettier enhances the readability and maintainability of your TypeScript code.

4. **Debugger for Chrome:**

   - Debugger for Chrome allows debugging TypeScript files directly within VS Code, bypassing the Chrome Dev Tools.
   - With sourceMaps enabled, breakpoints can be set in VS Code, providing a seamless debugging experience.

5. **Debugging Process in VS Code:**
   - Enable sourceMaps in your TypeScript configuration and compile your code.
   - Set breakpoints in your TypeScript files within VS Code.
   - Configure the launch.json file, pointing to localhost:3000 and specifying the webRoot.
   - Run the debugging process through VS Code, utilizing the Debugger for Chrome extension.
   - Utilize the debugging view in VS Code to inspect variables, watch expressions, and navigate the call stack.
   - Debugging can be paused, resumed, and stepped through with controls in the VS Code debugging interface.
