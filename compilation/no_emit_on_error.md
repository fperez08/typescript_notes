1. **Isolated Modules:**

   - Isolated modules cannot be ignored in TypeScript, and their errors need to be addressed in order to generate JavaScript files.

2. **No Emit on Error Option:**

   - `noEmitOnError` is an option in TypeScript that can be set to true or false, with the default being false. When set to false, TypeScript generates JavaScript files even if there are errors in the TypeScript code.

3. **Handling Potential Errors:**

   - If there are errors in TypeScript files, JavaScript files are still generated by default. This behavior might be acceptable if you have errors that don't impact the final app or if you are unsure how to address them immediately.

4. **Default Behavior - False:**

   - The default behavior (`noEmitOnError` set to false) allows TypeScript to generate JavaScript files even when errors are present, potentially leading to files with issues.

5. **Setting to True:**
   - Setting `noEmitOnError` to true ensures that problematic files with errors are not generated as JavaScript files. This option encourages addressing and fixing errors before generating output files.
