1. **SourceMap Purpose:**

   - `SourceMap` is a TypeScript compiler option designed to enhance debugging and development processes.

2. **Debugging Enhancement:**

   - Without the `sourceMap` setting, debugging in the browser developer tools shows only the compiled JavaScript files, making it challenging to debug TypeScript directly.

3. **Enabling SourceMap:**

   - By setting `sourceMap` to `true` in the `tsconfig.json` file and recompiling with the `tsc` command, TypeScript generates `.js` and `.map` files.

4. **SourceMap Functionality:**

   - The generated `.map` files act as a bridge between the compiled JavaScript files and the original TypeScript files. They allow browsers and developer tools to link and display TypeScript code during debugging.

5. **Debugging Convenience:**
   - Enabling `sourceMap` provides the convenience of placing breakpoints directly in TypeScript files, significantly improving the debugging experience, especially in more complex projects.
