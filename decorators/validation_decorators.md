**Decorators for Validation Example:**

- **Validation Class Implementation:**

  - A new class, "Course," is introduced with properties "title" (string) and "price" (number) along with a constructor.
  - The constructor assigns values to the title and price properties.

- **Form Input and Listener:**

  - A simple HTML form is created with text and number inputs for course title and price, respectively.
  - A submit event listener is added to the form to prevent the default form submission and extract title and price values.

- **Dynamic Course Creation:**

  - The form input values are used to create a new instance of the "Course" class.
  - Validation is currently absent, allowing the creation of a course with potentially invalid data.

- **Decorator Concept for Validation:**

  - The need for validation arises, especially when dealing with user inputs or external data sources.
  - A decorator concept is introduced, initially with two decorators: "Required" and "PositiveNumber."

- **Decorator Implementation:**

  - Decorators are added to class properties to define validation rules. For example, "Required" is added to the title, and "PositiveNumber" is added to the price.

- **Validation Registry:**

  - A registry mechanism is implemented to store information about which properties require validation and what type of validation is needed.
  - The registry keeps track of class names, property names, and associated validators.

- **Validation Logic:**

  - A validation function, "validate," is created to run through the registered validators and perform validation based on the defined rules.
  - The validation function checks if the object's properties meet the specified criteria and returns a boolean value indicating validation success or failure.

- **Usage and Testing:**

  - The "validate" function is invoked on the created course object, ensuring that the specified validation rules are applied.
  - Validation results are used to control the flow and display appropriate messages.

- **Enhancements and Considerations:**
  - A more elaborate implementation could involve a third-party library providing decorators and validation functions.
  - The current implementation is a basic example, and further refinement is possible for real-world scenarios.

**Note:** This implementation provides a foundational understanding of how decorators can be employed for validation. In practical scenarios, comprehensive validation libraries and practices should be considered for robust data validation.
