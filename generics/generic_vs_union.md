1. **Clarification on Generics vs Union Types:**

   - Addresses the common source of confusion between generics and union types, emphasizing the need for clarity in understanding their differences.

2. **Example with Union Types:**

   - Demonstrates an example using union types in the context of a data storage class. Explains that using union types allows for accepting various data types in an array, but also highlights the potential drawbacks, such as lack of specificity.

     ```typescript
     class DataStorage {
       private data: (string | number | boolean)[] = [];
       addItem(item: string | number | boolean) {
         // Code to add item
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Issues with Union Types:**

   - Points out the problems with union types, such as the inability to enforce a specific type for the entire class instance. Explains that union types are permissive, allowing any of the specified types with each method call, potentially leading to errors.

4. **Return to Generic Types:**

   - Reverts to using generic types to showcase the preferred approach. Emphasizes that generic types lock in a specific type for the entire instance, providing a more stringent type control.

     ```typescript
     class DataStorage<T> {
       private data: T[] = [];
       addItem(item: T) {
         // Code to add item
       }
     }
     ```

5. **Guidance on Usage:**
   - Provides guidance on when to use union types and when to use generic types. Suggests using union types when flexibility is needed for different types in each method call and using generic types when consistency in the type is desired throughout the class or function.

Understanding these distinctions helps developers make informed choices based on the specific requirements of their code.
