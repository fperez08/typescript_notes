1. **Setting Up Project for Generics:**

   - Describes the process of setting up a dummy project using NPM and TypeScript.
   - Recommends running `npm start` for the development server and `tsc -w` in a separate terminal for TypeScript compilation.

2. **Introduction to Generics:**

   - Explains the concept of generics in TypeScript.
   - Highlights that generics are types connected to another type, providing flexibility in dealing with different data types.
   - Introduces the built-in generic types, starting with arrays.

     ```typescript
     const names: string[] = ["Max", "Manuel"];
     ```

3. **Understanding Generic Types:**

   - Demonstrates the concept of generic types by looking at the array type.
   - Emphasizes that arrays are generic types capable of storing data of various types.
   - Explains two ways of defining array types: using square brackets or the `Array` type with angle brackets.

     ```typescript
     const names: Array<string> = ["Max", "Manuel"];
     ```

4. **Generic Type - Promise:**

   - Explores another built-in generic type, the Promise type.
   - Illustrates the creation of a promise and the role of generics in specifying the type of data the promise eventually yields.

     ```typescript
     const promise: Promise<string> = new Promise((resolve) => {
       setTimeout(() => {
         resolve("This is done");
       }, 2000);
     });
     ```

5. **Benefits of Generic Types:**

   - Discusses the advantages of using generic types, providing specific type information to TypeScript.
   - Highlights improved type safety and better TypeScript support when working with generic types.
   - Encourages the use of generics in building more complex classes or functions.

     ```typescript
     promise.then((data) => {
       data.split(" "); // TypeScript provides better support due to generic type information
     });
     ```

Generics in TypeScript allow for increased flexibility and type safety, especially when dealing with data structures like arrays and promises. They provide a way to express types that are connected to other types, enabling better TypeScript support in various scenarios.
