**Namespace and Module in TypeScript:**

1. **Namespace Feature:**

   - Introduced the namespace feature in TypeScript, used for encapsulating code and preventing naming conflicts.
   - Demonstrated how to create a namespace by enclosing code within curly braces after the `namespace` keyword, giving it a name (e.g., `DD Interfaces`).

2. **Exporting from Namespace:**

   - Highlighted that items inside a namespace are not automatically accessible outside of it.
   - Used the `export` keyword to make interfaces (or any other code) available outside the namespace, allowing them to be used in other files.

3. **Importing Namespace:**

   - Utilized a special comment syntax (/// <reference path="..."/>) in TypeScript to import a namespace from another file.
   - Showed how to use the imported namespace by creating a corresponding namespace in the importing file and including the required code inside it.

4. **Splitting Namespaces Across Files:**

   - Explained that namespaces can be split across multiple files by exporting items and using the special import syntax.
   - Illustrated the process with an example, emphasizing that imported code needs to be within the same namespace in the importing file.

5. **Compiling and Concatenating Files:**
   - Addressed the compilation and concatenation challenges when using namespaces.
   - Used the TypeScript `outFile` option to concatenate multiple files into a single JavaScript output file (e.g., `bundle.js`).
   - Adjusted the `module` option to `AMD` to support bundling alongside `outFile`, allowing the creation of a bundled JavaScript file for production use.

**Note:** While namespaces provide a way to structure and encapsulate code in TypeScript, the module system offers an alternative approach, which is explored in subsequent sections. Namespaces can lead to complex management of dependencies and may not align with modern JavaScript development practices. The module system, supported by TypeScript, provides a more scalable and modular solution for organizing and importing/exporting code.
