**TypeScript 5.3 Release Highlights:**

1. **Unmentioned Significant Change:**

   - TypeScript 5.3 introduced a noteworthy change that was not explicitly highlighted in the release notes.

2. **Working with Readonly Arrays:**

   - In TypeScript, working with `readonly` arrays can be challenging, especially when ensuring conformance to specific types.

3. **Satisfies Keyword:**

   - Introduced the `satisfies` keyword to handle scenarios where a `readonly` array needs to conform to a particular type.
   - Demonstrated how using `satisfies` allows the declaration of `readonly` arrays with specific types without causing errors.

4. **Const Type Parameters Improvement:**

   - Addressed an issue with const type parameters in TypeScript 5.2, where constraints were not accurately inferred.

5. **Relaxed Rules for Readonly Arrays:**

   - TypeScript 5.3 relaxed rules related to `readonly` arrays, providing more flexibility.
   - Highlighted that the `satisfies` keyword now accepts `readonly` arrays, resolving issues that existed in TypeScript 5.2.

6. **Improved Const Type Parameter Inference:**

   - Explained how const type parameters now correctly infer the type passed in, leading to more intuitive behavior.
   - Compared code examples between TypeScript 5.2 and 5.3 to illustrate the improvement.

7. **Usage of Readonly for Readonly Arrays:**

   - Clarified that specifying `readonly` is still necessary when desiring a `readonly` array back, even though the changes in TypeScript 5.3 make const type parameters and `satisfies` easier to work with.

8. **Overall Improvement:**
   - Emphasized that TypeScript 5.3's adjustments make working with `const` type parameters and `satisfies` more straightforward, eliminating the need for complex workarounds required in TypeScript 5.2.
