- **Typescript Introduction:**
  Typescript introduces various types to JavaScript, expanding the available data types beyond those native to JavaScript itself.

- **Core Types in JavaScript and Typescript:**
  Typescript supports core data types that JavaScript recognizes, such as numbers, strings, and Booleans. These types function similarly in both languages.

- **Number Type:**
  In JavaScript and Typescript, there is a single number type that encompasses both integers and floating-point numbers. There are no distinct types for integers or floats.

- **String Type:**
  Both JavaScript and Typescript include the string data type, representing text. Strings can be defined with single quotes, double quotes, or backticks, with the latter supporting template literals.

- **Boolean Type:**
  The Boolean data type in both JavaScript and Typescript is limited to the values `true` or `false`. Understanding Booleans is crucial, especially when working with conditional statements like IF statements. The concept of truthy and falsy values is highlighted, indicating values that are treated as true or false in conditional contexts.
