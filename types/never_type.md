- **Introduction to the Never Type:**

  - The `never` type in TypeScript represents a situation where a function or expression never produces a value or reaches completion.
  - It is used to indicate scenarios where an operation leads to an interruption or an infinite loop.

- **Usage of the Never Type:**

  - The `never` type is applied when a function is designed to never return a value or when an operation is expected to have no end.

- **Example Scenario - `generateError` Function:**

  - In the `app.ts` file, a function named `generateError` is created to generate error objects and throw them.

    ```typescript
    function generateError(message: string, code: number): never {
      throw { message, errorCode: code };
    }

    generateError("An error occurred", 500);
    ```

- **Explanation:**

  - The `generateError` function is designed to throw an error with the provided message and code.
  - The interesting aspect is that the function never returns a value (`void`) and actually can be explicitly marked as returning `never`.
  - Attempting to use the return value of this function, like logging it, would be futile, as the script essentially crashes when an error is thrown.

- **Using `never` for Clarity:**

  - While TypeScript may infer `void` as the return type, explicitly using `never` provides clarity to other developers about the intended behavior of the function.
  - In situations where the function is designed to never return, marking the return type as `never` is a good practice.

- **Other Scenarios for `never`:**

  - Functions with infinite loops, such as `while (true)`, also fall into the category of returning `never`. These functions continuously run and do not reach completion.
    ```typescript
    function infiniteLoop(): never {
      while (true) {
        // Infinite loop
      }
    }
    ```

- **Conclusion:**
  - The `never` type in TypeScript is a valuable addition for indicating scenarios where a function or operation never completes or returns a value. It is particularly useful for functions designed to throw errors, creating clear and explicit code that communicates its behavior effectively. While `void` may be inferred in some cases, using `never` adds precision and clarity to the codebase.
