- **Return Type in TypeScript Functions:**
  In TypeScript, functions can have explicit return types, and TypeScript infers return types based on the implementation. The return type is specified using a colon (`:`) followed by the type after the parameter list.

- **Void Return Type:**

  - **Usage:**

    - The `void` return type is used when a function doesn't explicitly return a value.
    - It signifies that the function completes its execution but does not produce any specific result.

  - **Example:**
    ```typescript
    function printResult(num: number): void {
      console.log("Result: " + num);
    }
    ```

- **`undefined` in TypeScript:**

  - **Type:**

    - `undefined` is a valid type in TypeScript.
    - It represents a variable or value that has not been assigned a value.

  - **Example:**

    ```typescript
    let someValue: undefined;
    ```

  - **Note:**
    - In JavaScript, a function that doesn't have a `return` statement effectively returns `undefined`.
    - However, TypeScript distinguishes between `void` and `undefined` in the context of function return types.

- **Differences between `void` and `undefined`:**

  - **`void`:**

    - Indicates that a function doesn't have a return statement.
    - Preferred when a function is intentionally designed not to return any value.
    - Used explicitly in the return type declaration.

  - **`undefined`:**
    - Represents a type in TypeScript.
    - Rarely used as a return type for functions.
    - Can be inferred by TypeScript, but using `void` is more common for functions that don't return values.

- **Best Practices:**

  - **Prefer `void`:**

    - Use `void` for functions that intentionally don't return a value.
    - Provides clarity that the function is designed not to produce a specific result.

  - **Rare Use of `undefined`:**
    - Use `undefined` only in scenarios where it's specifically required.
    - Generally, `void` is the standard choice for functions without return values.

- **TypeScript Inference:**

  - TypeScript can often infer return types based on the function's implementation.
  - Explicitly specifying return types is recommended only when necessary.

- **Demo Scenario:**

  - The `printResult` function demonstrates the use of `void` as a return type.
  - The differentiation between `void` and `undefined` in TypeScript is highlighted, emphasizing the preference for `void` in function return types.

- **Note on Undefined as a Type:**

  - While `undefined` is a valid type in TypeScript, its direct use as a function return type is relatively rare.
  - Understanding the distinction between `void` and `undefined` contributes to writing more explicit and accurate TypeScript code.

- **Conclusion:**
  - The `void` return type is a clear indication that a function is not designed to produce a specific result, enhancing code readability and maintainability. Understanding TypeScript's approach to function return types, especially in comparison to JavaScript, is essential for effective TypeScript development.
