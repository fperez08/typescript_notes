- **Type Checking in JavaScript:**
  JavaScript provides the `typeof` operator, a built-in feature, to determine the type of a given value. This operator is not specific to TypeScript but is available in vanilla JavaScript.

- **Type Validation in JavaScript:**
  In JavaScript, developers can use the `typeof` operator to improve function robustness by checking if the type of a variable matches the expected type. For example, checking if `typeof n1 === 'number'` and `typeof n2 === 'number'` before performing an operation.

- **Downsides of JavaScript Type Validation:**
  While type validation in JavaScript can improve runtime behavior by catching errors, it has downsides. Errors are only discovered during runtime, and unnecessary errors may occur, which could have been prevented with TypeScript during development.

- **Dynamic Typing in JavaScript:**
  JavaScript is dynamically typed, allowing variables to change types during runtime. This flexibility can lead to errors that are only identified at runtime, making it challenging for developers to catch and fix issues earlier in the development process.

- **Static Typing in TypeScript:**
  TypeScript, being statically typed, requires developers to define types during development, reducing the chance of runtime errors. If TypeScript code violates type rules, errors are caught during the compilation process, providing early feedback to developers.

- **TypeScript vs. JavaScript Types:**
  TypeScript introduces a broader range of types compared to JavaScript. While JavaScript recognizes basic types like numbers, strings, and Booleans, TypeScript supports a more extensive set of types, making runtime checking in JavaScript less flexible and powerful than static typing in TypeScript.

- **TypeScript Development Support:**
  TypeScript features and checks are only available during development. They are not built into the JavaScript engine and cannot execute at runtime in the browser. TypeScript code needs to be compiled to JavaScript to run in a browser, allowing developers to catch and fix errors before deployment.
