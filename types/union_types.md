- **Union Types in TypeScript:**
  A union type in TypeScript allows a variable, parameter, or property to hold values of multiple types. This flexibility is useful when a certain piece of code can handle different types of data.

- **Syntax:**
  The syntax for a union type involves using the pipe (`|`) symbol between the types. For example, `number | string` denotes a union type that can hold either numbers or strings.

  ```typescript
  function combine(
    input1: number | string,
    input2: number | string
  ): number | string {
    // ...
  }
  ```

- **Use Case - Combining Numbers and Strings:**
  In the example, the `combine` function takes two parameters, `input1` and `input2`, both of which can be either numbers or strings. The function aims to perform addition if both inputs are numbers and string concatenation if one or both are strings.

- **Type Guard with `typeof`:**
  To handle the different types within the union, a runtime type check is performed using the `typeof` operator. This helps TypeScript understand the specific type within the union at runtime and allows for appropriate logic execution.

  ```typescript
  if (typeof input1 === "number" && typeof input2 === "number") {
    // Addition logic
  } else {
    // String concatenation logic
  }
  ```

- **Runtime Type Check:**
  The `typeof` checks ensure that TypeScript knows the types involved in the operation, and the logic can be adjusted accordingly. This pattern is common when working with union types to handle different scenarios based on the actual types of the variables.

- **Flexibility and Trade-offs:**
  Union types provide flexibility but may require additional runtime checks in some situations. The developer needs to consider the specific logic requirements and adjust the code accordingly. While union types offer versatility, excessive use of `any` or complex unions might reduce the benefits of static typing.

- **Practical Example:**
  The `combine` function demonstrates the concept by allowing the addition of numbers and concatenation of strings. The use of union types ensures that the function can handle both scenarios without sacrificing type safety.

- **Considerations:**
  When working with union types, it's essential to consider how the different types interact and whether additional runtime checks are needed. TypeScript's static type checking helps catch potential errors during development, but developers should be mindful of ensuring that the runtime behavior aligns with the type expectations.
